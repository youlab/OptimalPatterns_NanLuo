Nan Luo, Shangying Wang, Jia Lu, Xiaoyi Ouyang, Lingchong You.
Molecular Systems Biology, 2021

* **Optimization models**: 
  The codes for the optimization models of colony growth.
  * OptimalModel1D.m: The model with 1D branch extension. Generates results in Figure 2 and Figure 3.
  * OptimalModel2D.m: The model with 2D branch extension. Generates results in Figure S3 and Figure S4.
  
* **Pattern prediction**: 
  The codes for simulating colony patterns using the optimization principle.  
  * OptimalPattern_uniform.m: Predicting colony patterns under uniform conditions. Generates results in Figure 4 and Figure S5.  
  * OptimalPattern_hetero.m: Predicting colony patterns under heterogeneous conditions. Generates results in Figure 5.  
  * OptimalPattern_multiseeding.m: Predicting colony patterns with various seeding configurations. Generates results in Figure 6 and Figure S8.
